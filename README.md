I created BookShelf to showcase my ability to build a fully functional CRUD application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about books and wanted to create a platform where users can track their favorite reads, jot down notes, and manage their personal book collection. This project serves as my first step toward developing a more comprehensive book management system, and I hope to expand its features over time! I'm also in a process of opening my own bookstore with Ukraian books, so I created this app for my clients, so they can leave reviews for other clients and it's easier for them to chose what they want to read
