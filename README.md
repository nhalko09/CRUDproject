BookShelf it an app where you can share all of your thoughts with some friends from your book club, or advise some strangers on if they should or should not read the book.I created this app to keep track of meaningful thoughts and reviews for my friends, without relying on a physical book. It provides a personal space to store special moments, making them easy to revisit anytime.
